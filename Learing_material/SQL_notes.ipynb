SQL Server\n","- Microsoft owns SQL Server. close sourced.\n","- Large enterprise applications mostly use SQL Server.\n","- Microsoft offers a free entry-level version called Express but can become very expensive as you scale your application.\n","\n","5.

While this may sound confusing, don’t worry! We want to stress that the basic syntax you will learn can be used in both systems.\n","\n","For example, the syntax to create tables, insert data into those tables, and retrieve data from those tables are all identical.\n","\n","`That’s one of the nice parts of learning SQL — by learning the fundamentals with one RDBMS, you can easily begin work in another.`\n","\n","That being said, let’s take a look at some of the more subtle details:\n","\n","\n","File extensions — when working with databases on Codecademy, take a look at the name of the file you’re writing in. If your file ends in:\n","\n","- .sqlite, you’re using a SQLite database.\n","- .sql, you’re working with PostgreSQL.\n","\n","Data types — You’ll learn about data types very early into learning a RDBMS. One thing to note is that SQLite and PostgreSQL have slightly different data types. For example, if you want to store text in a:\n","- SQLite database, you’ll use the TEXT data type.\n","- PostgreSQL, you have many more options. You could use varchar(n), char(n), or text. Each type has its own subtle differences. This is a good example of PostgreSQL being slightly more robust than SQLite, but the core concepts remaining the same.\n","\n","Built-in tables — As you work your way through more complicated lessons on databases, you’ll start to learn how to access built-in tables.\n","\n","For example, if you take our lesson on indexes, you’ll learn how to look at the table that the system automatically creates to keep track of what indexes exist.\n","\n","Depending on which RDBMS system you are using (in that lesson we’re using PostgreSQL), the syntax for doing that will be different. Any time you’re writing SQL about the database itself, rather than the data, that syntax will likely be unique to the RDBMS you’re using.\n","\n","**Conclusion**\n","\n","Relational databases store data in tables. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records. Relational database management systems (RDBMSs) use SQL (and variants of SQL) to manage the data in these large tables.
