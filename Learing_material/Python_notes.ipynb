However, the term “bug,” in the sense of technical error, dates back at least to 1878 and with Thomas Edison.\n","\n","Python refers to the mistakes within the program as errors and will point to the location where an error occurred with a ^ character. When programs throw errors that we didn’t expect to encounter, we call those errors bugs. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces bugs debugging.\n","\n","During your programming journey, you are destined to encounter innumerable red errors. Some even say that 75% of development time is spent on debugging. But what makes a programmer successful isn’t avoiding errors, it’s knowing how to solve them. And a good place to start is understanding what they are.\n","\n","In Python, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but here are some common ones:\n","1. SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.\n","2. NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown. Or forgetting to define a variable\n","3. TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.\n","4.

This is default behaviour where Python offers a namespace for the module. A namespace isolates the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module from the code in the file doing the importing. Your local namespace, meanwhile, is where your code is run.\n","\n","Python defaults to naming the namespace after the module being imported, but sometimes this name could be ambiguous or lengthy. Sometimes, the module’s name could also conflict with an object you have defined within your local namespace.\n","\n","Fortunately, this name can be altered by aliasing using the as keyword:\n","\n","`import module_name as name_you_pick_for_the_module`\n","\n","Aliasing is most often done if the name of the library is long and typing the full name every time you want to use one of its functions is laborious.\n","\n","You might also occasionally encounter import *. The * is known as a “wildcard” and matches anything and everything. This syntax is considered dangerous because it could pollute our local namespace. Pollution occurs when the same name could apply to two possible things. For example, if you happen to have a function floor() focused on floor tiles, using from math import * would also import a function floor() that rounds down floats.\n","\n","Let’s combine your knowledge of the random library with another fun library called matplotlib, which allows you to plot your Python code in 2D.\n","\n","You’ll use a new random function random.sample() that takes a range and a number as its arguments.

We have a deterministic algorithm that suits our needs. However, in this program, we have four steps that do not take a long time.

However, as the number of customers piles up, this can be incredibly inefficient for the deli.\n","\n","We can view concurrent programming as multiple lines of customers with access to one register. In this model, we might have three separate lines. The cashier can pick one of the customers who is ready to order from the front of a line. This can speed up ordering for the deli as if a customer decides they are not quite ready to order yet, they can let one of the other people in the front of the line go ahead.\n","\n","We can view parallel programming as multiple lines of customers with access to multiple registers. In this model, there are multiple registers that can divide up the customers. This way, the deli is more likely to avoid long lines and run a more efficient operation.\n","\n","Finally, we can also have asynchronous programs. If we add this paradigm to our analogy, we can view it as having a wait queue where each customer has a ticket. Once a customer’s food is ready, their ticket gets called. However, the tickets don’t necessarily get called in order; instead, any ticket can be called once the customer’s food is ready.

Now let’s see how we can speed up our Python programs with the threading module!\n","To review, a thread is a unique flow of execution. Theoretically, multiple threads mean the ability to run multiple things at the same time. However, in Python, threads do not actually run simultaneously; they merely appear to do so. Still, we will find that threading can increase the speed of our program. Generally, threading will perform much better than sequential programming if tasks within your program spend a lot of time waiting for external events to occur.\n","\n","To create a thread instance in Python, we use the following code:\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","import threading\n","example_thread = threading.Thread(target=some_function, args=(some_arg,))\n","```\n","\n","The two main parameters we will focus on are:\n","- target: this is the function you want to execute with thread(s).

We would use the following code:\n","```\n","t = threading.Thread(target=analyze_list, args=(l1, l2, l3))\n","```\n","\n","After creating our thread instance, we also have to “start” our thread using .start().

Some common methods for deploying applications are:\n","\n","1. Manual deployment: In this method, the application is manually installed and configured on each target system. This method is suitable for small-scale deployments and simple applications but can be time-consuming and error-prone for larger deployments.\n","\n","2. Scripted deployment: In this method, the application deployment process is automated using scripts or configuration management tools. This method is more efficient than manual deployment and allows for greater consistency and repeatability.\n","\n","3. Containerization: In this method, the application is packaged into a container along with its dependencies and runtime environment. This container can then be deployed to any platform that supports the containerization technology, such as Docker or Kubernetes. Containerization provides greater portability and scalability than other deployment methods.\n","\n","4. Virtual machine deployment: In this method, the application is deployed on a virtual machine (VM) running on a host system. This method provides greater isolation and security than other deployment methods and allows for greater flexibility in terms of the target platform.\n","\n","5. Cloud deployment: In this method, the application is deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Cloud deployment provides greater scalability, reliability, and availability than other deployment methods and can also be more cost-effective for certain types of applications.\n","\n","6. Serverless deployment: In this method, the application code is deployed to a serverless platform such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. The platform automatically manages the runtime environment and resources required to run the application, and users are only charged for the actual usage of the application. This method can be more cost-effective and scalable than other deployment methods for certain types of applications.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HT568LyGOB8r"}}]}
