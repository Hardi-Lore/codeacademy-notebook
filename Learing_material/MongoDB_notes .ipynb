Relational databases, commonly referred to as SQL databases (more on this later), structure data in tabular form. This means data is grouped into tables, using rows and columns to organize and store individual records of data. Here is what the general structure looks like:\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%203.png)\n","\n","Let’s apply the idea of a relational database to a concrete example. Imagine we launched a music streaming website where users find information about artists and their catalog of songs. How might we organize and store this content in a relational database?\n","\n","We’d probably have one table that stores information about albums. Within the albums table, we’d have several columns to store specific information about each album, such as its title and release year. Additionally, we could store songs, and artist information in separate tables. Here is what our tables might look like:\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%204.png)\n","\n","Relational databases are unique because they are based on presenting data in terms of relationships. To accomplish this, relational databases enable associations between tables to be defined, the most common associations being “one-to-one”, “one-to-many”, and “many-to-many”. For example, in our music database, we could establish the following relationships between our data:\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%205.png)\n","\n","In the above image, we have established two relationships:\n","- A relationship between the Songs and Albums table. A song “belongs” to an album via the album_id field.\n","- A relationship between the Albums and Artists table. An album “belongs” to an artist via the artist_id field.\n","\n","Lastly, note the following important properties of relational databases:\n","\n","- Pre-defined Schema: Relational databases are unique because the database schema - the “blueprint” of the database structure - is typically determined before any data is ever inserted. This would mean we would likely decide the specific tables, and their associated relationships, before even inserting any data into them.\n","- SQL Use: Developers communicate with a relational database using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is an industry-standard database language that has been used for decades. Extensive documentation and readable syntax make it approachable for beginners. The dependence of relational databases on SQL is why some developers and documentation sometimes refer to relational databases as SQL databases.\n","- Relational Database Management System: Any relational database is managed by a relational database management system (RDBMS). This type of DBMS allows the data to follow a relational model (e.g., setup relationships) and manage the data using SQL. Two of the most popular RDBMSs are PostgreSQL and MySQL.\n","- Unique Disadvantages: At the enterprise level, where data sets are massive, setting up a relational database can be costly, and the expenses required to maintain and scale it can compound significantly over time.

A non-relational database, commonly referred to as a NoSQL database, is any database that does not follow the relational model.

Under the umbrella of non-relational databases are many different types of databases, each with its own framework for organizing data. Some examples are document databases, graph databases, and key-value databases. Collectively, non-relational databases specialize in storing unstructured data that doesn’t fit neatly into rows and columns.\n","\n","To visualize the difference, let’s return to our music database and examine what the data would look like in a NoSQL format.

Additionally, non-relational databases are well suited for expansion or scalability and are relatively inexpensive to maintain compared to relational databases.\n","- Custom Query Language: Unlike relational databases that all use SQL as a standard query language, most NoSQL databases have their own custom language.\n","- Unique Disadvantages: Since the data in non-relational databases is mainly unstructured, data can often become hard to maintain and keep track of. Additionally, since every NoSQL database uses its own custom query language, there is a new learning curve for each one we choose to work with.\n","\n","```\n","How do relational databases differ from non-relational databases?\n","```\n","\n","Relational databases structure data into tables with columns and rows and allow developers to pre-define relationships between these groups of data.

In the case of MongoDB, this flexibility comes partly from a data format called Javascript Object Notation, or JSON (jay-sahn). JSON is simply a text format for storing data. Here is what JSON looks like:\n","\n","```\n","{\n","  \"name\": \"Randy\",\n","  \"occupation\": \"geo-scientist\",\n","  \"years_of_experience\": 7\n","}\n","```\n","\n","  In the above example, we have JSON that stores information about a job applicant for a position at our camera store. Note that JSON stores data as what is known as “key-value” pairs, which are always within a pair of curly braces (“{ }“). MongoDB and various online resources also refer to these pairs as “field-value” or “name-value” pairs. For the purposes of this course, we will refer to them as “field-value” pairs. Here is a breakdown of what fields and values mean in the context of JSON:\n","\n","- Fields: A field is a unique identifier for a data point; it tells us what kind of data is being stored. In the job application JSON we just examined, the fields are \"name\", \"occupation\", and \"years_of_experience\". Note that JSON field names must be double-quoted (“ “). There are a [number of opinions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5543490/json-naming-convention-snake-case-camelcase-or-pascalcase) with respect to how these names should be formatted.\n","- Values: Every field has an associated value. The values are the data points themselves. In our camera store applicant example, the values are \"Rodney\", \"photographer\", and 7, each of which corresponds to their respective field. Note that JSON can host a variety of data types in value fields such as strings, numbers, arrays, or even nested data. Additionally, each of these field-value pairs must be separated by a comma (“ , “).\n","\n","The primary advantage of JSON is readability and flexibility. Data is stored in an easily editable format that is totally comprehensible to humans as well as our computers. However, convenience ultimately comes at a price.\n","\n","There are three main drawbacks to storing data as JSON:\n","1. JSON is inefficient from a computational perspective as text is time-consuming to parse.\n","2. Its readability as text also means that it is not efficient storage-wise. For example, it might be helpful for us to have descriptive names of fields, but they tend to be longer and, for that reason, take up more space.\n","3. JSON only supports a very limited number of data types – dates, for instance, are not supported natively.\n","\n","While there are some clear advantages to using JSON to format data, these drawbacks make JSON a poor choice as a primary storage format inside databases.

Recall that with MongoDB, as opposed to a relational database, we have the flexibility to organize our data without the constraint of a predefined schema. The absence of a schema-based structure means we will have to think even more deeply about how we will structure our data. This concept is called data modeling.\n","\n","Data modeling as a practice is the process of developing and choosing a way to structure our data and its relationships. The way we choose to organize our data has long-lasting implications on a database’s scalability, maintainability, and performance. In this article, we will explore the techniques and processes behind data modeling in MongoDB.

A good data model can provide structure and organization to what might be a diverse and complex set of information. A bad model can make even simple data challenging to work with.\n","\n","Imagine, for instance, that we decide to use MongoDB to store information about our photography business. We want to store a few things: the name of the event we’re photographing, the location, and the client’s name. This data is relatively simple, but consider how two different ways of modeling it could change our database’s usability and efficiency.\n","\n","First, let’s examine Model A:\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%2013.png)\n","\n","In this model, we have three collections, one for the event details, one for the locations, and one for our clients.

Here is a breakdown of each:\n","- Model A: This model might offer better data integrity. This is because data can be shared across multiple collections instead of being duplicated. For example, we have a single location record in the location collection that multiple events can reference. Additionally, because we are not duplicating records, the overall usage of storage can be lower compared to Model B. However, as previously mentioned, this model will likely take longer to query because we need to query three different collections to gather data.\n","- Model B: This model might offer performance benefits. Any query for a single event will take less time (and likely developer effort) than Model A since we only have to query one collection. As more and more documents get added, this model would see positive performance implications. However, this model would have a higher occurrence of duplicated data. This is because each of the fields (e.g., location) is not shared across multiple collections. So, for example, if we had a popular location (e.g. “Niagara Falls”) that was used across multiple events, we might have multiple copies of that value across multiple documents.\n","\n","In essence, choosing a data model suited for our data and application is essential for any developer. Every application is unique and may even require us to refactor our data model later down the line as the requirements of the database change.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vl0UkmpAu-sg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Modeling Relationships in MongoDB\n","\n","In addition to deciding the overall structure of our collections, another consideration is how to represent relationships between data. First, let’s think about why relationships between data are important. Take the example of a database that stores data about cars.\n","\n","A document containing information about a car will likely have information like the color and size, which are attributes of the car itself. However, it may also contain information about the car’s engine.\n","\n","The engine, being its own entity, possesses attributes separate from the overall car. If we want to store data about how powerful the engine is, it wouldn’t then seem quite right to make engine_power an attribute of the car since it is an attribute of the engine instead. In addition, we would have to ponder what the relationship between the car data and the engine are in the context of our whole database. We might ask, “Is the engine being shared amongst other cars in our database, or does it belong to only a single car?”\n","\n","Our data modeling challenge would be to decide how best to represent the engine as a separate entity, its relationship to the car, and it’s relationship across the collection. To establish these types of relationships in MongoDB, we have two options: embedded documents or references. Let’s explore each of these options!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"r2MSPnbQvmMl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Embedded documents\n","One way to establish a relationship in MongoDB is to use embedded documents. This method allows us to nest data related to a document directly inside of it! These nested documents are called sub-documents.

Here is our car and engine example, modeled with an embedded document:\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","// car Document\n","{\n","    car_id: 48273,\n","    model_name: \"Corvette\",\n","    engine:{\n","        engine_power: 490,\n","        engine_type: \"V8\",\n","        acceleration:\"High\"\n","    }\n","}\n","```\n","In the above example, notice how the engine data is nested inside the car document.

For example, we can think of a database storing data with a relationship between a car and its unique license plate. Each record of a car has only one license plate.\n","- Modeling relationships that map one entity to many sub-entities, also known as an one-to-many relationship.

This is where the update parameter comes into play. To specify how we want to update a document, we can use MongoDB update operators. MongoDB offers us several update operators that can perform a variety of modifications to document fields. In this exercise, we’ll focus on the $set update operator. This operator allows us to replace a field’s value with one that we provide.\n","\n","To see this in action, imagine a new phone model is launching soon, and the price of the \"iPhoneX\" will need to be decreased in order to remain competitive. We want to update the price from 1000 to 679. We can accomplish this by running the following command:\n","```\n","db.products.updateOne({ title: \"iPhoneX\" }, { $set: { price: 679 } });\n","```\n","If successful, the operation should return:\n","```\n","{ \"acknowledged\" : true, \"matchedCount\" : 1, \"modifiedCount\" : 1 }\n","```\n","After running the previous command, we could query for the item to confirm the update was successful:\n","```\n","db.products.findOne({ title: \"iPhoneX\" })\n","```\n","\n","And find our document was updated:\n","\n","\n","```\n","{\n","  _id:ObjectId(fjwirjgiwjjt2903u45rtj8349uhr),\n","  title: \"iPhoneX\",\n","  price:1000,\n","  stock: 679\n","},\n","```\n","In this case, querying on the title field works fine, assuming the value is unique for every document.

The `.findAndModify()` method modifies and returns a single document. By default, the document it returns does not include the modifications made on the update. This method can be particularly useful if we want to see (or use) the state of an updated document after we perform an update operation. This method also has a lot of flexible optional parameters that aren’t available in other methods.\n","\n","Let’s take a look at the syntax of the `.findAndModify()` method below:\n","\n","```\n","db.<collection>.findAndModify({\n","  query : <document>,\n","  update : <document>,\n","  new : <booleqan>,\n","  uosert : <booleqan>,\n","  ...\n","});\n","```\n","Note that there are four commonly used fields:\n","- query: Defines the selection criteria for which record needs modification.\n","- update: A document that specifies the fields we want to update and the changes we want to make to them.\n","- new: When true, this field returns the modified document rather than the original.\n","- upsert: Creates a new document if the selection criteria fails to match a document.\n","- Note: In addition to these fields, the `.findAndModify()` method accepts many other options. We will not be covering them here, but more details can be found in the documentation for the `.findAndModify()` method.\n","\n","With this method, there are a lot of scenarios that can occur. First, let’s consider a collection called foodTrucks containing the following document:\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","{\n","  _id:ObjectId(...),\n","  name: \"Criff Dogs\",\n","  address: \"15 bedford Ave\",\n","  shtudown: false\n","},\n","{\n","  _id:ObjectId(...),\n","  name: \"sals Pizza\",\n","  address: \"249 Otter Place\",\n","  shtudown: false\n","}\n","```\n","\n","The first scenario we can observe is if we wanted to update a document and see the updated document state pre-modification (before it was changed). This is the default behavior of the method. So, if we were to change the shutdown property of the document above with the name \"Criff Dogs\", we can run the following command:\n","\n","```\n","db.foodTrucks.findAndModify({\n","  query : {\"Criff Dogs\"},\n","  update : {shtudown: true}\n","});\n","```\n","\n","The output of this method would be the document before it was modified. Notice the shutdown field is still false, even though we changed it to true:\n","\n","\n"," Output\n","```\n","{\n","  _id:ObjectId(...),\n","  name: \"Criff Dogs\",\n","  address: \"15 bedford Ave\",\n","  shtudown: false\n","}\n","```\n","\n","The next scenario is similar but would use the new field to return a different output. If we ran the following query:\n","\n","```\n","db.foodTrucks.findAndModify({\n","  query : {\"Criff Dogs\"},\n","  update : {shtudown: true},\n","  new: true\n","});\n","```\n","We would be able to see the new modified document as the output. Notice the value in the output for the shutdown field is true:\n","\n","Output\n","```\n","{\n","  _id:ObjectId(...),\n","  name: \"sals Pizza\",\n","  address: \"249 Otter Place\",\n","  shtudown: true\n","}\n","```\n","\n","Lastly, we can use the upsert field to be able to add documents if they do not currently exist in the database. So if we ran the following command:\n","\n","```\n","db.foodTrucks.findAndModify({\n","  query : {name: \"Ben and Jerry\", address: \"17 Cliff Pl\"},\n","  update : {shtudown: false},\n","  new: true,\n","  upsert: true\n","});\n","```\n","MongoDB would then search the collection foodTrucks based on the query argument, and if it didn’t find a match, it would create the document. So our new food truck would be added to the collection, and our return output would be:\n","\n","\n","Output:\n","```\n","{\n","  _id:ObjectId(...),\n","  name: \"Ben and Jerry\",\n","  address: \"17 Cliff Pl\",\n","  shtudown: false\n","}\n","```\n","We might notice that `.updateOne()` and `.findAndModify()` behave quite similarly. Both will update a document in our database or create one if it doesn’t exist. So what are the main differences? Well, `.findAndModify()` returns the document that you modify, whereas `.updateOne()` does not. Moreover, `.findAndModify()` allows us to specify whether we want to return the old or new (modified version) of the updated document with the use of the new parameter.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xSm8b9O2UDEu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let’s practice using the `.findAndModify()` method with our restaurants collection!\n","\n","Ex\n","1.

At scale, this would be a huge expenditure of time, computing power, and money. Fortunately, there’s a tool that can help make certain queries much more efficient - indexing. An index is a special data structure that stores a small portion of the collection’s data set in an easy-to-traverse form.\n","\n","Let’s use a real-world example to understand how indexing in MongoDB works. Suppose in your global history class your assignment is to write an essay about Japan. Naturally, you’ll want to find all references in your history textbook about the country. But how can you find all pages that mention Japan? One method would be to look meticulously through every page in the textbook. This method is tedious, exhausting, and a poor use of your time. Using an index, however, you could go to the letter “J” in the index, locate Japan, and proceed to the corresponding pages listed.\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%2045.png)\n","\n","Using an index to look up all references of the word “Japan” is a much more efficient way to search compared to a complete scan of the book. Indexes in MongoDB seek to capture that same efficiency and optimize query performance. Queries that don’t use indexes must parse every document in a collection to find the appropriate matches. For relatively small collections this is fine, but as a collection grows this can begin to weigh down performance.\n","\n","Which of the following is a downside to querying an entire MongoDB collection without proper indexing?\n","- The query must run through every single document within the collection before returning a result.\n","  - Correct! This can put a considerable strain on computing power and bandwidth depending on the size of the collection.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XRUyx3SSWJV9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The Types of Indexes in MongoDB\n","MongoDB supports several different types of indexes. You can, for instance, create an index that references only one field of a document - also known as a single-field index. If, for example, a high school principal wanted to organize a reunion for alumni who studied abroad in Argentina, they would want to run a query on all alumni who studied internationally, specifically in Argentina. Rather than query the entire alumni collection, they could capture a subset of this data by creating a single-field index on a field that’s exclusive to these alumni, for example, study_abroad_nation. Let’s take a look at what this single field index might look like:\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%2046.png)\n","\n","The principal can now use this single field index to query specific study abroad countries, like Argentina. This index makes our query more economical because it allows us to scan a subset of data rather than every document in the collection. Furthermore, because indexes arrange data in ascending or descending order, our queries are able to more quickly locate matching documents, making them more optimized for speed.\n","\n","You can also create indexes on multiple fields, called compound indexes, to support more specific queries. If that same high school principal wanted to organize these alumni based on the year they studied abroad, he or she could create a compound index that references the country where students studied abroad and when they studied abroad. The principal can now use this index to query specific countries, and, since indexes are ordered they can easily sort that subset of matching students chronologically. Notably, the sorted nature of indexes can also improve the efficiency of range-based query operations, where we are seeking to match values that span a given range.\n","\n","One last type of index worth mentioning is multikey indexes. These indexes support optimized queries on array fields by indexing each element in the array. Conveniently, MongoDB automatically creates a multikey index for us whenever we create an index on a field whose value is an array. Multikey indexes are compatible with both single field and compound indexes.\n","\n","\n","A high school principal wants to create an index of all alumni who played sports with the field “sports_played” . If it’s possible that a particular alumnus/a could have played more than one sport, what would we call that index?\n","- Single field multikey index\n","  - Correct!

Indexes are most beneficial when they support queries which are selective in nature (the result set represents a small portion of the data in the collection). We should also aim to be conservative, and plan ahead when creating indexes. Each index consumes valuable space. And while indexes can improve query performance, they do so at the cost of write performance. Each time we insert, remove, or update documents in a collection, MongoDB must reflect those changes for each index in the collection, ultimately slowing down the operation. With proper planning, indexes can greatly leverage the power of MongoDB and optimize your queries to improve computing performance, bandwidth, and time efficiency.\n","\n","What is the greatest tradeoff to consider when creating indexes?\n","\n","- Slower performance for create, update, and delete operations.\n","  - Correct!

Multikey indexes create an index key for each element in the array.\n","- A compound index cannot support two multikey indexes.\n","- The `.dropIndex()` method deletes an index without modifying the original collection.\n","\n","In addition to the syntax we’ve learned throughout this lesson, MongoDB offers us other syntax and commands that can be useful when indexing collections:\n","- [Partial Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-partial/?utm_campaign=academia_partners&utm_source=codecademy&utm_medium=referral) only index documents in a collection that meet specific filter criteria. By indexing a subset of a collection’s documents, partial indexes consume less storage and have improved performance.\n","- [Sparse Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-sparse/?utm_campaign=academia_partners&utm_source=codecademy&utm_medium=referral) only index documents that include the specified index field. Any documents that do not have the field will be excluded from the index.

At some point, we may decide that we want to perform some form of analytics. Take, for example, a database that stores sales data for an online store. We can use the methods we have learned so far (e.g.,` find()`) to perform CRUD operations related to the data, but maybe we want to answer questions related to trends like:\n","\n","- What kind of products are selling the best over a six-month period?\n","- What product is making the most sales on Wednesdays?\n","- Is there a specific geographic location that tends to order more products than others?\n","\n","These questions are best answered by performing more complex analytical operations on our database. With some databases, we might have to use a completely separate tool set to perform analytics. However, with MongoDB, the ability to perform these types of queries is already built-in! This process is known as aggregation and is one of the core features of a MongoDB database. In this article, we will explore aggregation and how it works in MongoDB.\n","\n","Specifically, we will:\n","- Explore the basics of how the aggregation pipeline works in MongoDB.\n","- Build an aggregation pipeline together using multiple stages and operators.\n","- Consider the right situations to use aggregation.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sjP4oItFsHX_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Aggregation Basics\n","In plain terms, to aggregate means to combine out of several parts. When we apply this concept to a MongoDB database, aggregation is the process by which we can sift through large amounts of data one step at a time and, at each step, perform some form of filtering or computation on the data. Then, after multiple steps, we return a final result. This process can help us to see our data in a new way and provide valuable insights. So, how do we actually perform aggregation? One of the primary ways to accomplish aggregation in MongoDB is to use an aggregation pipeline.\n","\n","An aggregation pipeline is a channel through which data passes from point A (the start of the pipeline) to point B (the end of the pipeline). Imagine, though, that the pipe is split into a number of segments. Each of these segments in the aggregation pipeline is called a stage, and each stage performs a specific operation on the data, such as sorting or filtering. Take a look at the following visual to help paint a picture of the pipeline:\n","\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%2047.png)\n","\n","If we use the above image as a guide, we can note that at the start of our pipeline, we will have our original dataset (a collection). Then, at the first stage and at successive stages, an operation is performed on the data, and the result is either sent to the next stage or returned if there are no more stages. There can be many stages involved depending on what we might be trying to accomplish with our pipeline.\n","Now that we know what aggregation and an aggregation pipeline is, let’s see how we can create our own in MongoDB.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tP1cDisssdBi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Getting Started with Aggregation\n","To start using aggregation via an aggregation pipeline in MongoDB, we can use the following `.aggregate()` method like so:\n","```\n","db.<collection>.aggregate()\n","```\n","\n","\n","MongoDB requires that inside of the `.aggregate()` method, our first argument is an array containing the pipeline stages we use. To see a pipeline stage in action, let’s imagine we had the following small collection called movies, with each record having a field with the movie name and an associated rating (using the USA-based MPA rating system):\n","```\n","{\n","  name: \"Star Wars: Clone Wars\",\n","  rating: \"PG\"\n","},\n","{\n","  name: \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\",\n","  rating: \"PG\"\n","},\n","{\n","  name: \"Despicable Me\",\n","  rating: \"PG\"\n","},\n","{\n","  name: \"The Godfather\",\n","  rating: \"R\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","We saw earlier, that in order to build a pipeline, we will need to define the stages we want to use. There are many stages in MongoDB that help accomplish various tasks in aggregation. For now, let’s use a common stage called $match that returns all the documents containing the specified field and value. This is similar to when we used the `.find()` method and provided a query argument to filter a document based on a specific criteria.\n","\n","The syntax to accomplish this aggregation would be the following:\n","\n","```\n","db.movies.aggregate([\n","  {\n","    $match: {rating: \"R\"}\n","  }\n","]);\n","```\n","And our result would be:\n","\n","```\n","{\n","  name: \"The Godfather\",\n","  rating: \"R\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","We are tasked with gaining insights on students that might qualify for a prestigious scholarship. We need to produce a new collection in our database called candidates that has the following criteria:\n","- The collection must only contain students in the 6th grade with an average test score above 97.\n","- The students in the new collection must be sorted by their first name (first_name field).\n","\n","We also want the records in the new collection to have a new field called highest_score with the value of the highest score in the test_scores array field. This type of task would be a great candidate for using the aggregation framework!\n","\n","We can start our aggregation pipeline with a first stage that filters out only students in the 6th grade with an average test score above 97. Just like before, we can use the `$match` stage:\n","\n","```\n","db.students.aggregate([\n","  {\n","    // First stage\n","    $match: {grade_level: 6, average_test_score {$gt: 97}}\n","  }\n","]);\n","```\n","This first stage with $match should give us all the students that meet the conditions to qualify.\n","\n","Next, we want to sort our result. Thankfully, MongoDB provides a stage named $sort. Similar to how the `.sort()` method works, we can specify -1 or 1 to sort in ascending or descending order for a field. Here is what our pipeline would look like if we added a sorting stage:\n","\n","```\n","db.students.aggregate([\n","  {\n","    // First stage\n","    $match: {grade_level: 6, average_test_score {$gt: 97}}\n","  },\n","  {\n","    // second stage\n","    $sort: {first_name: 1}\n","  }\n","]);\n","```\n","This new stage would take the resulting collection from the first stage (where we used $match) and sort the documents in ascending order by the first_name field.\n","\n","At this point, we might think, “Why use an aggregation pipeline when I can accomplish the same goal with `.find()` and `.sort()` much quicker?”. That is a valid point, and if you likely had to just do those two stages, using `.find()` and `.sort()` likely would be quicker. However, the next two stages are where aggregation would start to shine as a better alternative.\n","\n","First, let’s accomplish adding a new field to our records called highest_score with the value of the student’s highest test score. We can do so using the $addFields stage. Before we add it to our pipeline, let’s examine the syntax of this operator:\n","\n","```\n","{ $addFields: { <newField>: <expression>, …}}\n","```\n","> Note this stage uses what is known as a expression. Aggregation expressions are commonly used in stages to perform some type of logic such as arithmetic or comparisons. There are many types of expressions including: literals, system variables, expression objects, and expression operators. Here is what our pipeline looks like if we needed to get the highest score and create a new field:\n","\n","```\n","db.students.aggregate([\n","  {\n","    // First stage\n","    $match: {grade_level: 6, average_test_score {$gt: 97}}\n","  },\n","  {\n","    // Second stage\n","    $sort: {first_name: 1}\n","  }\n","  {\n","    // Third stage\n","    $addFields:{\n","      Highest_score: {$max: \"$test_scores\"}\n","    }\n","  }\n","]);\n","```\n","\n","Here, we are using the `$addFields` stage with the `$max` expression operator, a specific type of expression, which allows us to pull the max value of the test_scores field so we can use it in our new highest_score field. Note that our test_scores field is prefixed with a `$` to indicate it is a field path. Field paths are used to access a document’s fields inside of an expression. We will have to use field paths often when working with aggregation. In this case, it allows us to access the test_scores field from our documents to use with the $max expression operator.\n","\n","If we left it as is, our result from our aggregation pipeline would have documents like this:\n","\n","```\n","{\n","  _id: ObjectId(...),\n","  first_name \"Joseph\",\n","  last_name: \"Tapia\",\n","  grade_level: 5,\n","  test_scores: [99, 97, 96, 99],\n","  average_test_scores: 87.5,\n","  highest_scores: 99\n","\n","\n","}\n","```\n","So far, so good! We just have one final task in our pipeline: creating a new collection. Creating a new collection can be accomplished by using the `$out` stage. Here’s how our pipeline would look after adding the `$out` stage:\n","\n","\n","```\n","db.students.aggregate([\n","  {\n","    // First stage\n","    $match: {grade_level: 6, average_test_score {$gt: 97}}\n","  },\n","  {\n","    // Second stage\n","    $sort: {first_name: 1}\n","  },\n","  {\n","    // Third stage\n","    $addFields:{\n","      Highest_score: {$max: \"$test_scores\"}\n","    }\n","  },\n","  {\n","    // First stage\n","    $out: \"candidates\"\n","  }\n","]);\n","```\n","\n","The `$out` stage can output the final result of an aggregation pipeline to a new database, a new collection, or both! For this reason, it is required that it is the last stage in a pipeline. In this case, our aggregation result would be plopped into a new collection named candidates.\n","\n","Whew! We did it. We went through a general overview of how to build a multistage pipeline, step by step, with a few common aggregation stages. Note that the order of the aggregation stages is important since data will flow in the order we supply our operators.\n","\n","Now that we have had a chance to build a pipeline, it’s worth thinking about when we actually need to use aggregation and build our own pipelines.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Fgi_4VOwsm3v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## When to Use Aggregation\n","When we compare the ways we can manipulate data with methods like `.find()` and `.updateOne()` to an aggregation pipeline, we can start to see a major difference.\n","\n","Most of the CRUD methods that MongoDB offers are operational in nature. Their role is to perform some specific operation on our data and that’s it. With aggregation pipelines, we are able to perform multiple operations together to curate data that is more analytical in nature. This helps us see our data in a bigger picture.\n","\n","A good way to picture the difference is to return to a web application that makes sales of some product. The application needs to give users the ability to perform common CRUD operations like adding a product to their cart or increasing the quantity they want to purchase. These types of operations are best handled with the functions we already know (e.g, `.find()`, `.updateOne()`). However, if we had an option to have a seller dashboard that can give insights on product sales or trends, our CRUD methods wouldn’t be as helpful since they’re not able to manipulate any of the data. That’s where we can see aggregation really shine!\n","\n","In essence, consider using aggregation when:\n","\n","- There are no CRUD methods (or a combination of methods) that accomplishes the query that needs to be performed easily.\n","- We need to perform analysis on datasets such as grouping values from multiple documents, computations on data, and analyzing data changes over time.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DL-Rcy9v5rY0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Wrap Up\n","In this article, we learned about what makes aggregation a powerful tool for searching and filtering data in MongoDB.

They are responsible for persisting organized collections of data for applications. This ability to store and access data for use at a later date allows applications to provide persistent experiences for their users and can be seen in use in almost any application in some form. Databases vary in their implementations and, as such, provide different advantages and disadvantages. These differences should be taken into account when designing an application as they can have a significant impact on overall performance.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fInYxagWaszq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Relational Database\n","A relational database, commonly referred to as a SQL database, is a type of database that uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables. Data in a relational database table is stored as rows, called records, with each consisting of one or multiple columns that have a specific data type (ie: INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATETIME, etc). Relational databases come with many advantages, some of which include high accuracy and flexibility. Due to the normalized state of relational data it is only stored once within the database. This means that data only has to be updated in one location. Additionally, this structure allows for extreme query flexibility with users being able to JOIN data from multiple tables to create the specific, tailored dataset they are looking for at any given time.\n","\n","While these advantages are great, they are mirrored by some disadvantages. One disadvantage is that normalization can lead to slower access times for queries that are extremely complex (pulling large amounts of data from multiple tables). Another disadvantage is cost. Relational databases are vertically scalable, which means that increasing load requires increasing server hardware power.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-3ObgF2Xa1of"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Non-Relational Database\n","A non-relational database, commonly referred to as a NoSQL database, is any database that does not follow the relational model provided by traditional relational database management systems. Non-relational databases specialize in storing unstructured data that doesn’t fit neatly into rows and columns. Non-relational databases are great when scalability is key. The flexibility of their schema allows for updates to the database to handle changing application requirements fairly easily. Additionally, increased access load is handled horizontally rather than vertically as with their relational counterparts. This helps keep cost down as many cheaper commodity servers can be used rather than investing in expensive hardware. These two advantages combine to make non-relational databases prime candidates for Big Data demands.\n","\n","While non-relational databases have great performance and cost at scale, they do suffer from some disadvantages. Due to the fact that the data is largely unstructured, accuracy can be more complex to maintain. Query flexibility is also somewhat degraded when it comes to accessing data. In order to service its high scalability needs, access patterns for non-relational data oftentimes have to be largely planned up front. While the ultimate outcome of this is extremely fast data access, it can limit the types of access, making subsets of queries extremely fast while leaving other queries that weren’t pre-planned to suffer from potential performance penalties.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TX4MpQOJa7FL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Graph Database\n","A graph database is a database that is designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. This means that data is not stored with a predefined model and is instead stored showing how each individual entity connects with others. Graph databases are extremely flexible as their schemas are able to adapt over time, adding new relationships between entities easily. This allows for quick adaptation to changing business needs without incurring too much technical debt. Additionally, graph databases offer very fast data lookup capabilities with the ability to have constant time traversals for large datasets against single entities. An area where graph databases can falter somewhat are in business intelligence and data analytics applications where aggregations are required. While this isn’t an impossible task for these databases, it isn’t fully optimized for this type of access."],"metadata":{"id":"Q--BLJsPa-9O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","```\n","![link text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardi-Lore/codeacademy-notebook/main/pictures/Learn%20MongoDB%2044.png)\n","```\n","\n","\n","```\n","`\n","```\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YEpGmmcJYFh7"}}]}
